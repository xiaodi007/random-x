# `randomX` Module

## Overview

The `randomX` module provides functions for random selection and weighted selection from a vector. It is designed to help you select one or more elements randomly, or based on assigned weights, making it very useful in scenarios where selection probability needs to be considered.

## Functions

```move
choice: Selects a single element from a given vector of elements.
choices: Selects multiple elements from a given vector of elements.
weighted_choice: Selects a single element from a given vector of elements based on the corresponding weights.
weighted_choices: Selects multiple elements from a given vector of elements based on the corresponding weights.
random_permutation: Generate a random permutation.
weighted_random_permutation: Generate a weighted random permutation.
sample_without_replacement:  Sample multiple elements without replacement.
weighted_sample_without_replacement: Sample multiple elements with weights without replacement.
```
